# Sort markdown files

This is just a tiny program that can only sort a specific format of markdown files that I used.

That format is what I used to take English notes:

    ### vigorous
    
    1. Vigorous physical activities involve using a lot of energy, usually to do short and repeated actions.
    2. A vigorous person does things with great energy and enthusiasm. A vigorous campaign or activity is done with great energy and enthusiasm.
    3. A vigorous person is strong and healthy and full of energy.
    
    > - Very vigorous exercise can increase the risk of heart attacks…
    > - African dance is vigorous, but full of subtlety.
    
    ### predominantly
    
    1. You use predominantly to indicate which feature or quality is most noticeable in a situation.
    
    > - His audience consists predominantly of groups of rugby-club revealers.
    > - Although it is predominantly a teenage problem, acne can occur in early childhood…
    
This program can sort these vocabularies based on its headers (start with `###`)

You can use command line argument to indicate input and output file name.
